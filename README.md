# IBAproject

In JSONserver folder there is json server. PLease before starting project run "npm run json:server" code in that folder.
Hope you like it. I made simple design

## IBAproject mobile
Project was written with nativescript. I didn't like it. It has a lot of problems. Maybe some people can work with it without any problem.
- First of all i couldn't understand why when project starts i get error. Then i change some lines and save changes it compiles codes then it works. It happens without any reason. In internet saw a lot of people who face this problem.
- I use tns preview for starting project with playground app. Tried to work with tns run android but i get errors again.
- fetching data from js-server works correctly for web. But it returns undefined for mobile. Reason can be related local server. I used Swapi then there was no problem. That's why there are services for mobile datas. It works as expected, but for session. It doesn't keeps datas permanently which is added later. 
-For design i wanted to ad side drawer for showing projects' list. I faced with errors again. Tabs worked but it wasn't suitable for this project

Maybe you can think they are pretext but really i worked with it whole day for a week. nativescript is really bad for mobile development. Thought about changing choice it would be late complite task

## Have a nice day
